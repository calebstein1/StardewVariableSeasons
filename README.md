# Stardew Variable Seasons

A mod for Stardew Valley that adds some variability to when the seasons actually change, rather than just changing on the first of each season.

Seasons will now change on a random day between 23 of the current season and 7 of the next season, weighted around 1 of the next season.
For example, the actual change from Spring to Summer can now occur on any day between Spring 23 and Summer 7.

About halfway through a season, the weather channel will give hints as to the length of the season, letting the player know whether the current season will be abnormally short, shorter than average, about average, longer than average, or abnormally long.

This mod will also include a mechanic to allow out-of-season crops to survive for some amount of time based on a percentage that decreases each day the crop remains out of season, and will allow for the purchase of crops for the next season from the general store.

This mod is still in very heavy development and is currently in a very alpha state, I hope to have beta releases prepared by February.

TODO:
- [x] Figure out if season changes can be decoupled from the in-game calendar, otherwise really make sure there are no bugs in the current implementation, like the one where a season-change date from Spring to Summer that occurs after Summer 1 will cause the year to increment between Spring 28 and Summer 1
- [ ] Add weather channel hints
- [ ] Add crop survival mechanic
- [ ] Modify general store inventory
